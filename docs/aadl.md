The Analysis Activity Description Language (AADL) consists of an Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for the abstract description of bioinformatics analysis activities.
AADL also aims at allowing the description of the underlying (command-line) tools that support these activities, in order to facilitate the adaptation of these tools using model-based development strategies.
